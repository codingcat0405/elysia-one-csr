# Elysia One — API

Bun backend: Elysia (HTTP), MikroORM/PostgreSQL (data), BullMQ/Redis (background jobs), Winston (logging), [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) (username/password, bearer token auth) on a `better-auth-mikro-orm` adapter over the same MikroORM pool. Exports an `App` type consumed by `apps/client` via Eden Treaty for end-to-end type safety — see "Eden Treaty type export" below.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 48), DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL
bun install
bun dev                 # watch mode; schema auto-sync on boot (see "Schema" below)
```

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui` — requires the explicit opt-in `ENABLE_SWAGGER=true`, in dev or prod (there is no `NODE_ENV`-based auto-enable)
- Bull Board (job dashboard): `http://localhost:3000/bull-board`, opt in with `ENABLE_BULL_BOARD=true` + `BULL_BOARD_USER`/`BULL_BOARD_PASSWORD` (HTTP Basic Auth, separate from the app's session auth)
- Background worker (BullMQ), separate process: `bun worker:dev`

**Linting and formatting:** Code quality is managed at the repository root:

- `bun run lint` (from root or here via Turborepo) runs `oxlint` — shared config across all workspaces.
- `bun run format` / `bun run format:check` (from root only) runs Prettier with a shared root-level config.

Docker: the `Dockerfile` uses `turbo prune`, which needs the **repo root** as build context, not this directory — see the root [`README.md`](../../README.md#docker):

```bash
# from the repo root, not packages/api/
docker build -f packages/api/Dockerfile -t api .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env -e NODE_ENV=production api
```

For the full stack (this API + worker + Postgres + Redis + the client) in one command, use `docker compose up --build` at the repo root instead — see the root README's "Docker" section.

## Architecture

Feature-based modules. The per-request `EntityManager` fork happens via Elysia `.derive()` in `setup.ts`. The only `RequestContext`/AsyncLocalStorage use is around Better Auth calls (see rule 2 below).

```
src/
  index.ts                    # boot: env checks, schema sync, composes + starts the Elysia app
                               # (mounts Better Auth's handler), graceful shutdown; exports `App`
                               # type for Eden Treaty (see below)
  worker.ts                   # separate process: BullMQ Worker(s), no HTTP server
  db.ts                       # cached initORM() — one MikroORM instance per process
  auth.ts                     # memoized initAuth(): Better Auth instance (username +
                               # bearer plugins) over the mikroOrmAdapter
  mikro-orm.config.ts         # driver, pool, result-cache adapter config
  bull-board.ts               # /bull-board dashboard plugin, Basic-Auth gated

  middlewares/
    setup.ts                  # per-request: em.fork() + service instances (the core pattern)
    responseMiddleware.ts     # auto-serializes MikroORM entities, strips `hidden` props
    errorMiddleware.ts        # maps HttpError / validation / 404 -> JSON, else generic 500

  macros/
    auth.ts                   # `checkAuth(roles)` macro: resolves the Better Auth session via
                               # `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`, injects `user`

  modules/
    profile/
      index.ts                # Elysia controller: GET /api/profile/{me,admin}, role-gated demo
      model.ts                # typebox request/response schemas
    user/
      queue.ts                # BullMQ Queue for this module's jobs (send-welcome-email)

                               # AuthUser, AuthSession, AuthAccount, AuthVerification

    http-errors.ts             # framework-free HttpError classes
    logger.ts                  # winston: pretty dev / JSON prod
    redis.ts                   # shared ioredis client (cache adapter)
    client-origins.ts          # shared CLIENT_URL parse (CORS + Better Auth trustedOrigins)
    bull-connection.ts        # DEDICATED ioredis connection for BullMQ
    RedisCacheAdapter.ts       # MikroORM result-cache adapter (Redis-backed); wired in as
                               # the default adapter, but no query opts in with `cache:` yet
    basic-auth.ts              # HTTP Basic Auth guard (Bull Board), timing-safe compare
```

### The rules that keep MikroORM happy

1. **One `em.fork()` per unit of work** — per HTTP request (`setup.ts`) and per BullMQ job (`modules/*/worker.ts`). Same discipline both places.
2. **Never use the global `orm.em` in modules** — only the derived `em` / services. Grep for `orm.em` outside `db.ts`, `setup.ts`, job processors, and the two `RequestContext.create(orm.em, ...)` wrappers (`index.ts`'s `.mount()`, `macros/auth.ts`) that work around `better-auth-mikro-orm` not forking the `EntityManager` itself, in review.
3. **Services are per-request instances, not singletons** — an app-lifetime object must never hold a request-lifetime `em`.
4. Controllers `.use(setup)` (and `.use(authMacro)` if they need auth) themselves — Elysia dedupes the plugin by name at runtime, but each file is typechecked on its own composition chain, so the context types (`em`, `user`) only resolve if the file declares the `.use()` itself.

### Schema: auto-sync, no migrations (intentional)

`index.ts` runs `orm.schema.updateSchema()` unconditionally on every boot — dev **and** prod. This is deliberate for this project: schema changes ship by changing entities, not by writing/running migration files. There is no `migrations` block in `mikro-orm.config.ts` and no `migration:*` scripts in `package.json` — don't add them unless explicitly asked. `@mikro-orm/cli` **is** an explicit `devDependency` (not a transitive one) — it's kept available for ad-hoc schema inspection/debugging via its CLI, not as a signal to wire up a migrations workflow.

If you change an entity, `updateSchema()` picks it up on next boot — no extra step needed. Keep this in mind for destructive changes (renaming/dropping a column): auto-sync applies the diff directly, there's no migration file to review before it runs against a real database.

### Pool sizing

Per-process pool via `DB_POOL_MAX` (default 10). Each running instance of the API (each k8s pod replica, each `bun start` process) owns its own pool: `total connections = replicas × DB_POOL_MAX` — keep that under Postgres `max_connections` with headroom, or put pgBouncer in front.

### Eden Treaty type export (end-to-end type safety)

`src/index.ts` exports `export type App = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof main>>` — the full Elysia app type, routes and typebox schemas included. `apps/client` imports it as `import type { App } from 'api'` (workspace dependency) and passes it to `treaty<App>(...)` (`@elysia/eden`) in `apps/client/src/lib/eden-client.ts`, giving the frontend compile-time-checked routes, request bodies, and response shapes with zero manual typing.

This only works if `packages/api`'s declaration output is built: `bun run build` (`tsc --emitDeclarationOnly`) writes `dist/index.d.ts`, which is what `package.json`'s `"types"` field points resolvers at. `dist/` is gitignored and **not** rebuilt automatically by `bun run dev` (Turborepo's `dev` task has no `dependsOn: build`). Practically:

- After cloning, run `bun run build` in `packages/api` (or `bunx turbo build --filter=api`) once before relying on `apps/client`'s eden types.
- Whenever you add/rename a route, or change a `model.ts` body/response schema, rebuild `packages/api` so `apps/client`'s types stay in sync — otherwise the client either type-checks against a stale contract or silently keeps working with outdated IDE hints until the next build.

`main` is also `export`ed as a value (not just its return type), specifically so route-level tests can `import { main } from '../../index'`, call it, and get a fully-composed `Elysia` instance to drive with `app.handle()` (see "Testing" below) — without accidentally double-booting the real server. `index.ts`'s bottom-of-file self-invocation is guarded by `if (require.main === module)`, which is only true when this file is the actual process entry point (`bun run src/index.ts`), never when a test file imports it.

### Background jobs (BullMQ)

- One **Queue per domain module** (e.g. `modules/user/queue.ts`), not one queue per job type — job data is a discriminated union (`{ type: '...' }`), dispatched via `switch (job.name)` in the module's `worker.ts`.
- Register every module's `Worker` in the top-level `src/worker.ts` — that's a **separate process** (`bun worker`/`bun worker:dev`), never started inside the HTTP server process.
- `utils/bull-connection.ts` is a **dedicated** ioredis connection (`maxRetriesPerRequest: null`, required by BullMQ's blocking commands). Never reuse the shared `utils/redis.ts` client for BullMQ, and vice versa.
- Enqueue jobs **after** the triggering DB write succeeds — never enqueue for a row that might still roll back (see `auth.ts`'s `databaseHooks.user.create.after`, which Better Auth fires only once the new user row is committed).

### Bull Board dashboard

Mounted at `/bull-board`, gated by HTTP Basic Auth (`utils/basic-auth.ts`, constant-time compare) — deliberately not the app's bearer-token session, since a browser-native dashboard can't attach an `Authorization` header. Boot fails fast (`index.ts`) if `ENABLE_BULL_BOARD=true` but `BULL_BOARD_USER`/`BULL_BOARD_PASSWORD` aren't set. Exposes internal job payloads — never expose this publicly without auth.

### Redis: two separate clients, on purpose

| Client           | File                            | Used by                 | Notes                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared client    | `utils/redis.ts` (`getRedis()`) | `RedisCacheAdapter`     | Singleton, retry-limited, safe for normal commands      |
| Dedicated client | `utils/bull-connection.ts`      | BullMQ `Queue`/`Worker` | `maxRetriesPerRequest: null`, required for blocking ops |

`mikro-orm.config.ts` falls back to `MemoryCacheAdapter` (per-process, not shared) when `REDIS_URL` is unset, but `index.ts`'s boot-time required-env check means normal `bun dev`/`bun start` never reaches that path — `REDIS_URL` is mandatory. The fallback only matters for code paths that import `db.ts` without going through `index.ts`'s checks (e.g. a test harness).

### Error handling

Services/macros throw `HttpError` subclasses (`utils/http-errors.ts`): `BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError`, `ForbiddenError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`. `errorMiddleware` maps these to their status + message; Elysia `VALIDATION`/`NOT_FOUND` codes are special-cased; anything else is logged server-side and returns a generic 500 (never leaks internal error text to clients).

### Response serialization

`responseMiddleware` auto-converts MikroORM entities (single or array) returned from handlers into plain objects via `wrap(entity).toObject()`, which also strips any `@Property({ hidden: true })` field. Return entities directly from handlers — don't hand-roll serialization, and don't skip the `response` typebox schema on routes (it's the second guarantee against leaking fields, independent of `hidden`).

**Exception: the four `Auth*` entities never use `hidden: true`.** `AuthAccount.password`/`accessToken`/`refreshToken`/`idToken` are genuinely sensitive but are **not** marked `hidden` — `better-auth-mikro-orm`'s adapter reads use MikroORM's `serialize()` internally too, which would silently drop those fields on Better Auth's own credential-verification reads, breaking login (see `entities/AuthAccount.ts`'s comment). The actual defense is structural: no route in `modules/*` returns an `AuthUser`/`AuthAccount`/`AuthSession`/`AuthVerification` entity — `modules/profile` builds a plain `{ id, username, role }` object from `checkAuth`'s resolved session instead. If you ever add a route that returns one of these entities directly, you've reopened this hole; return a hand-picked plain object instead.

## Deploying with bearer auth

The client (a React + Vite SPA) stores the session token in `localStorage` and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request, so the SPA and API can live on different registrable domains. Deployment constraints:

1. **CLIENT_URL must be the exact browser origin.** It feeds into `trustedOrigins`, Better Auth's allowlist for state-changing requests (sign-up, sign-in). Requests from an origin not on the list are rejected. `CLIENT_URL=https://app.example.com` works; a wildcard does not — and it is **not** boot-required, it silently defaults to `http://localhost:3001`, so double-check it explicitly in every environment.

2. **BETTER_AUTH_URL must be the exact public URL of this API in production.** Better Auth builds absolute URLs from it.

3. **Bearer tokens are not auto-sent by the browser.** CSRF risk is lower than with cookies — the browser won't attach a token to a malicious cross-site request. `trustedOrigins` adds an origin allowlist for state-changing requests.

4. **The `better-auth.session_token` cookie is issued but unused.** Better Auth's mounted handler sets it on sign-in and clears it on sign-out (there is no documented flag to suppress it). This app never reads, sends, or forwards it; it relies entirely on the bearer token.

## Testing

`bun test` (Bun's built-in, Jest-compatible runner — no extra dependency). Two layers, both co-located next to the source they cover as `*.test.ts`:

- **Pure unit tests** (`utils/*.test.ts`, `middlewares/errorMiddleware.test.ts`) — no external services, plain function calls with hand-built mock objects.
- **Route-level tests** (`modules/profile/profile.test.ts`) — Elysia's own unit-test pattern (`app.handle(new Request(...))`, see [elysiajs.com/patterns/unit-test](https://elysiajs.com/patterns/unit-test)) driven against this project's **real** Postgres + Redis, same as `bun dev`. There is no mocked/in-memory mode — requires `.env` filled in and both reachable. `beforeEach` truncates the auth tables so each test starts clean; the API itself is built once via `main()` in a `beforeAll` (imported from `index.ts`, which exports `main` specifically for this — importing it never double-boots the real app, see `index.ts`'s `require.main === module` guard).

### Running tests — do this from the right place

- **`bun run test` (repo root or here) is the supported entry point.** At the root it runs via Turborepo, which invokes each workspace's own `test` script _inside that workspace's directory_ — `packages/api`'s tests run with `packages/api` as the working directory, so its `.env` resolves normally.
- **Do NOT run a bare `bun test` from the repo root.** Bun's test runner recursively finds every `*.test.ts` file under the current directory regardless of workspace boundaries, so it picks up `apps/client`'s tests too — but it loads env files relative to _that_ CWD (the repo root), where there is no `.env` (only `packages/api/.env` exists, one level down). The DB-backed tests fail immediately with `Missing required env var: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, before Postgres/Redis reachability even comes into play. Either `cd packages/api && bun test`, or use `bun run test`.
- **Bun's own env precedence for `bun test`** also loads `.env.test` / `.env.test.local` on top of `.env`/`.env.local`, if present (`.env.test` wins on overlapping keys) — a Bun convention, not something this repo currently uses (there's exactly one Postgres/Redis config, reused for `bun dev` and `bun test` alike, truncated between tests rather than isolated in a second database). If you ever want test-specific overrides (e.g. a dedicated test database), add `packages/api/.env.test` — Bun picks it up automatically, no wiring needed.

CI is not set up (see gaps below), so these currently only run when someone runs them locally.

## Known gaps (don't assume these are solved)

- No CI (`.github/workflows` doesn't exist) — tests exist (see "Testing" above) but nothing runs them automatically.
- No rate limiting on `/api/auth/*` (sign-in/sign-up/etc. are unthrottled).
- No email verification (`user.emailVerified` is always `false`) and no password reset flow — the `verification` table exists (Better Auth core schema) but nothing writes to it; wiring either up means adding a mailer.
- **Session tokens live in `localStorage`, readable by injected JavaScript (XSS).** Mitigate with Content Security Policy headers and input sanitization.
- **No token refresh/rotation.** The token is valid until the session TTL expires or the user signs out.
- **Client-side auth guard only shows UI state.** The SPA's guard (`apps/client/src/routes/authed-layout.tsx`) validates the session client-side before rendering authed pages; the real security boundary is `checkAuth` on the API, which returns 401/403 regardless of client state.
